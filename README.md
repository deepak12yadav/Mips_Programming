# Mips_Programming
Assignments from our coursework on mips

Aim: Handling of local variables in subroutines by allocating space on stack. Handling (local) arrays
in MIPS.

Assignment statement: Finding the kth largest, 3 ≤ k ≤ 20, of n integers. Write a MIPS program
which:

(a) allocates space on stack for two local integer variables n and k; give comments indicating how
you would access in your program the memory locations corresponding to n, k and a[i].

(b) reads the integer k with the prompt: ”Enter the value of k:”;

(c) allocates space for a[i], 0 ≤ i < k, on the stack;

(d) reads an integer with the prompt – ”Enter the count of elements to be read:”

(e) finds the kth largest among the n elements read one by one using proper prompt(s) and

(f) prints the same within the message – ”The %d-th largest number among [a comma separated
list of the n numbers read] is:” h the k-th largest number i
